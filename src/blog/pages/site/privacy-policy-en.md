The responsible body decides alone or together with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, contact details, etc.).

#### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing

Some data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent that you have already given at any time.

#### Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority

As a data subject, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority in the event of a breach of data protection law.
