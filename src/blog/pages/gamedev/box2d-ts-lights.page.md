## Project Introduction

I've been working on a TypeScript port of [Box2D Lights](https://github.com/libgdx/box2dlights).

Hopefully this will soon be on Github for everyone to use, including a full Box2D eco-system with particles, LiquidFun and more. Stay tuned. WebGL is awesome.

Check out [the demo](https://lusito.github.io/box2d.ts/testbed/#/Lights#Draw_World)

**Update:** It's now available: https://lusito.github.io/box2d.ts/
