Hi, my name is Santo Pfingsten, also known as [Lusito](https://github.com/lusito/).

- I'm a senior software developer, currently employed at [jambit](https://www.jambit.com). 
- Before that, I've been working on various technologies, mostly web (full-stack) or games related.
- I studied digital media and games at the University of Applied Sciences in Trier.
- I started learning programming by working on game modifications.

I learned a lot from open-source projects and tutorials and I've always loved giving back to the community.

This is a blog on all the tech things I'm interested in, probably mostly focused on web- and game technologies.
